We are thrilled to announce the release of graphql-java v22.0! Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release, whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release, which includes major performance improvements. This release also introduces the `@defer` directive, which enables data to be received incrementally, rather than waiting until all data is resolved. This can reduce an application's time-to-interactive. See more on the `@defer` draft specification on the [GraphQL Working Group's GitHub repo](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md).

For the full details, please see the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v22.0).
