**Update: please use the v24 series of releases instead of v23 releases. We have made a clearer breaking change in Java DataLoader, thus we will discontinue v23.**

We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v23.0! Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to the release, whether that was code, helping to report issues, or participating in discussions.

This is a **breaking change** release. Included are performance improvements and features.

For the full details, please see the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v23.0).
