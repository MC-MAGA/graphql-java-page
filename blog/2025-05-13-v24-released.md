We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v24.0.

This release is an unexpected breaking change release. It was made to help propagate a fix in the DataLoader library.

We consider v23.x poisoned and we don't recommend you use it because of the latent bug explained in the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v24.0).

Going forward we will not be supporting v23.x, instead please skip this series and use v24.x going forward.
