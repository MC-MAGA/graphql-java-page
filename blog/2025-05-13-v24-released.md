We are pleased to announce the release of graphql-java v24.0.

This is a **breaking change** release, because of a new breaking change release in Java DataLoader 5.0.0, which makes a breaking API change clearer. Thanks to the community for the feedback.

As we have very recently released v23.0, we have decided to skip the v23.x series and move directly to v24.0. Do not use the v23.x series of releases going forward.

For the full details, please see the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/releases/tag/v24.0).
